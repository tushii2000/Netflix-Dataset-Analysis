# Netflix Content Analysis Project


## Overview

Welcome to the Netflix Content Analysis Project! This project aims to analyze various aspects of Netflix's extensive library, including the growth of movies and TV shows, genre distribution, country of origin, content duration, rating categories, release patterns, director and cast involvement, genre popularity over time, and much more.

## Data Cleaning

In this project, comprehensive data cleaning was performed to ensure the quality and integrity of the dataset. The cleaning process involved several steps aimed at standardizing and preparing the data for analysis.

1. **Standardizing Date Formats:**
   - The `release_date` column was converted into a standardized date format to facilitate easier analysis.
   - Additionally, a consistency check was implemented to ensure that the `release_date` does not exceed the `added_date`. Any discrepancies found were addressed by dropping the corresponding data entries, ensuring data accuracy.

2. **Handling Multi-Value Columns:**
   - Columns such as `cast`, `listed_in`, `country`, and `director` often contained multiple values separated by commas. To facilitate better analysis, these columns were transformed into lists, allowing for easier parsing and exploration of the data.
   - Furthermore, missing values in these columns were addressed by filling them with appropriate placeholders to maintain data integrity.

3. **Correcting Misplaced Data:**
   - During the data cleaning process, instances were identified where data was mistakenly placed or entered in incorrect columns. These errors were rectified to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the dataset.
   - By conducting thorough checks and validations, such discrepancies were identified and corrected, enhancing the reliability of the dataset for further analysis.

## Data Exploration and Visualization

- Created histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical features.
- Visualized the distribution of categorical features using bar charts or pie charts.
- Used boxplots to compare distributions across different groups or categories.
- Explored relationships between variables using scatter plots or correlation matrices.
- Employed Seaborn for more advanced visualizations like pairplots, heatmaps, etc.
